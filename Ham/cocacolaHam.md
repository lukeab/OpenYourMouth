### Cocacola Ham

There are numerous sources of cocacola ham recipes out there, but this is one i've made and enjoyed.

##### The Ham
2 kilograms mild-cure gammon joint
1 onion (peeled and cut in half)
2 litres coca-cola

##### The glaze
1 handful of cloves
1 heaped tablespoon black treacle
2 teaspoons english mustard powder
2 tablespoons demerara sugar

##### Method
1. To reduce the saltyness of the ham, put it in a covered pot of water and bring to the boil, then tip out the water.
2. Put the ham skin side down in the pot, with the onion and pour in the coke.
3. Bring to the boil for about 2 1/2 hours. (adjust proportionate to the weight of your ham)
